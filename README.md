### Constraints & Indexes

```cypher
-- Uniqueness Constraints
CREATE CONSTRAINT FOR (a:Act) REQUIRE a.name IS UNIQUE
CREATE CONSTRAINT FOR (s:Section) REQUIRE s.sectionId IS UNIQUE
CREATE CONSTRAINT FOR (am:Amendment) REQUIRE am.amendmentId IS UNIQUE
CREATE CONSTRAINT FOR (r:Rule) REQUIRE r.ruleId IS UNIQUE
CREATE CONSTRAINT FOR (p:Part) REQUIRE p.partId IS UNIQUE

-- Performance Indexes
CREATE INDEX FOR (s:Section) ON (s.number)
CREATE INDEX FOR (s:Section) ON (s.title)
CREATE INDEX FOR (r:Rule) ON (r.number)
CREATE INDEX FOR (am:Amendment) ON (am.type)

-- Full-Text Search Indexes
CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX section_fulltext FOR (s:Section) ON EACH [s.title, s.text, s.effectiveText]
CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX rule_fulltext FOR (r:Rule) ON EACH [r.title, r.text]
```

---

## 🏗️ Key Modeling Decisions

### 1. Dual Text Fields for Amendment Traceability

Each `Section` stores both `text` (the original enacted text) and `effectiveText` (after amendments are applied). This enables before/after comparison without losing the legislative history.

```cypher
-- Compare original vs. amended text for Section 149
MATCH (s:Section {number: 149})
RETURN s.text AS original, s.effectiveText AS current, s.isAmended
```

### 2. Typed Amendment Relationships (Not Generic "AMENDS")

Instead of a single generic `AMENDS` relationship, three specific types are used: `SUBSTITUTES`, `INSERTS`, `DELETES`. This mirrors real legislative drafting conventions and allows precise Cypher queries by amendment operation.

```cypher
-- Find all sections where text was substituted by the 2026 Amendment
MATCH (am:Amendment)-[:SUBSTITUTES]->(s:Section)
WHERE am.year = 2026
RETURN s.number, s.title, am.description
```

### 3. Bidirectional Amendment Links

Both `Section → AMENDED_BY → Amendment` and `Amendment → SUBSTITUTES → Section` exist. This optimizes queries from either direction — "what amendments affect Section X?" and "which sections does this amendment target?"

### 4. Two-Phase Data Ingestion Pipeline

- **Phase 1 — PDF Extraction**: `pdfplumber` parses all three PDFs (Companies Act: 370 pages, Rules: 195 pages, Amendment: 98 pages) using regex-based section recognition. This yields full coverage: **421 sections**, **43 rules**, **45 amendment clauses**.
- **Phase 2 — Curated Enrichment**: A hand-curated `sample_data.py` enriches the graph with subsections, precise amendment descriptions, cross-references, and rule categories. MERGE operations update PDF-created nodes rather than duplicating them.

### 5. Cross-Reference Context

`REFERS_TO` relationships carry a `context` property explaining *why* sections are linked — not just *that* they are linked.

```cypher
MATCH (s1:Section)-[r:REFERS_TO]->(s2:Section)
RETURN s1.number, s2.number, r.context
-- e.g. Section 149 → Section 152: "Independent directors under S.149(6) must meet conditions in S.152"
```

### 6. Graceful Degradation Architecture

The system operates in three tiers:
1. **Neo4j + Gemini AI** → Full graph queries with AI-generated responses
2. **Neo4j + Fallback Rules** → Graph queries with pattern-matched responses (no API key needed)
3. **In-Memory Store + PDF** → No database required; identical API responses from Python dictionaries

This ensures the system always works, even without Neo4j running or a Gemini API key.

### 7. AmendmentAct as Multi-Label Node

`AmendmentAct` carries both `:Act` and `:AmendmentAct` labels, allowing it to participate in queries for "all acts" while remaining distinguishable as an amending statute.

## 🚀 How to Run the System

### Prerequisites

| Requirement         | Version  | Notes                                                |
|---------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Python**          | 3.9+     | Required                                             |
| **Neo4j**           | 5.x      | Desktop or Server ([download](https://neo4j.com/download/)) |
| **Gemini API Key**  | —        | Optional ([get free key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)) |

### Step-by-Step Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/LexGraph-AI.git
cd LexGraph-AI

# 2. Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Neo4j password and (optionally) Gemini API key

# 4. Start Neo4j
#    Option A: Neo4j Desktop → Start your database
#    Option B: Command line → neo4j console

# 5. (Optional) Pre-ingest data into Neo4j
python scripts/ingest_data.py

# 6. Start the server
python run.py
```

Open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser.

> **Note**: If Neo4j is not running, the server automatically starts in **fallback mode** using an in-memory store. All features remain functional — just without persistent graph storage.

### What Happens at Startup

1. **PDF Parsing** — All three legal PDFs are parsed with `pdfplumber` (~30s for 10 MB of PDFs)
2. **AI Init** — Google Gemini model is loaded (or fallback rules activated)
3. **Neo4j Check** — Connection verified; if unavailable, in-memory store loaded
4. **Schema Setup** — Constraints and indexes created in Neo4j
5. **Data Ingestion** — Two-phase pipeline populates the graph (Phase 1: PDF → 421 sections; Phase 2: curated enrichment)

## 🔍 How to Run Queries

### Option 1: Web Interface (Recommended)

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and use the **AI Query** tab. Type natural language questions:

| Example Query                                          | What It Does                                    |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| "What does Section 149 say about independent directors?" | Retrieves Section 149 with full context         |
| "What amendments affected Section 185?"                | Lists all amendments targeting Section 185       |
| "What are the rules for CSR?"                          | Retrieves all CSR-related rules                  |
| "Define 'related party'"                               | Searches Section 2 definitions                   |
| "Compare original and amended text of Section 135"     | Shows before/after for CSR provision             |
| "Show me the knowledge graph statistics"               | Returns node/relationship counts                 |

### Option 2: REST API (curl / Postman)

```bash
# Natural language query
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/query/natural \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What amendments affected Section 185?"}'

# Interactive chat (with session memory)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Explain Section 149", "session_id": "my-session"}'

# Get a specific section
curl http://localhost:3000/api/section/149

# Get amendments for a section
curl http://localhost:3000/api/section/185/amendments

# Full-text search
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/search?q=independent+director"

# Health check
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

### Option 3: Direct Cypher Queries (Neo4j Browser)

Open Neo4j Browser at `http://localhost:7474` and run Cypher directly:

```cypher
-- 1. Get all sections of the Companies Act (with part info)
MATCH (a:Act {name: 'Companies Act'})-[:HAS_PART]->(p:Part)-[:HAS_SECTION]->(s:Section)
RETURN p.number AS part, p.title AS partTitle, s.number AS section, s.title
ORDER BY s.number

-- 2. Find all amendments and their target sections
MATCH (aa:AmendmentAct)-[:CONTAINS_AMENDMENT]->(am:Amendment)-[r]->(s:Section)
WHERE type(r) IN ['SUBSTITUTES', 'INSERTS', 'DELETES']
RETURN am.type AS amendmentType, type(r) AS operation,
       s.number AS targetSection, s.title AS sectionTitle,
       am.description AS description
ORDER BY s.number

-- 3. Trace the amendment history of a specific section
MATCH (s:Section {number: 185})
OPTIONAL MATCH (am:Amendment)-[r]->(s)
WHERE type(r) IN ['SUBSTITUTES', 'INSERTS', 'DELETES']
RETURN s.title, s.text AS originalText, s.effectiveText AS currentText,
       collect({type: am.type, description: am.description, year: am.year}) AS amendments

-- 4. Cross-reference traversal (2-hop)
MATCH path = (s:Section {number: 149})-[:REFERS_TO*1..2]->(related:Section)
RETURN s.number AS from, related.number AS to, related.title
ORDER BY related.number

-- 5. Find rules derived from a section
MATCH (s:Section {number: 135})<-[:DERIVED_FROM]-(r:Rule)
RETURN r.number, r.title, r.text, r.category

-- 6. Full-text search across all sections
CALL db.index.fulltext.queryNodes("section_fulltext", "independent director")
YIELD node, score
RETURN node.number AS section, node.title, score
ORDER BY score DESC LIMIT 10

-- 7. Graph statistics
MATCH (n)
RETURN labels(n)[0] AS label, count(n) AS count
ORDER BY count DESC

-- 8. Find all sections amended by the 2026 Act
MATCH (aa:AmendmentAct {year: 2026})-[:CONTAINS_AMENDMENT]->(am)-[:SUBSTITUTES|INSERTS|DELETES]->(s:Section)
RETURN DISTINCT s.number AS section, s.title, am.type AS amendmentType
ORDER BY s.number

-- 9. Section with all connected entities (neighborhood query)
MATCH (s:Section {number: 149})
OPTIONAL MATCH (s)-[r]-(connected)
RETURN s, r, connected

-- 10. Sections with the most amendments
MATCH (s:Section)-[:AMENDED_BY]->(am:Amendment)
RETURN s.number, s.title, count(am) AS amendmentCount
ORDER BY amendmentCount DESC
LIMIT 10
```

## 🧠 AI Integration

The intelligence layer uses **Google Gemini (gemini-2.0-flash)** for:

1. **Natural Language → Cypher Translation** — Schema-aware few-shot prompting converts questions to graph queries
2. **Grounded Response Generation** — AI generates structured, formatted answers from query results
3. **Section Explanations** — Full legal context with amendments, rules, and cross-references
4. **Conversational Chat** — Session-based memory for follow-up questions

**Traceability**: Every AI response includes the generated Cypher query, result count, processing time, and `grounded` flag indicating whether the answer is backed by graph data.

**Fallback**: When Gemini is unavailable, pattern-matching rules generate appropriate Cypher queries and structured responses — the system remains fully functional.
